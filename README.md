# TicTacToe-web-app
This project is a Progressive web app game I made to practice new web standards:  
ES6+, Javascript, CSS Grid / Houdini, PWA...

The files can be merged into a single HTML file, to act like an executable file, no frameworks, dependencies, etc...  
Just copy files and execute. it runs on your web based environment or chrome/other recent browsers.
