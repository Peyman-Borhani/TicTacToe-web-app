# TicTacToe Web app
This project is a Progressive web app game I made to practice semi native looking development without any dependencies.  
Other goals are: using new web standards, Vanilla JS, practice Design, UI-UX, unified architecture coding pattern:  
ES6+ / Vanilla JavaScript, new CSS Grid / Houdini, PWA. used for coding.

Just copy the HTML/JS/CSS files and execute, it runs on your web based environment or chrome/most recent browsers.
Other files are not mandatory, just an attempt to make a android app by TWA. also you can edit it into a single HTML file, to act like a executable file, no frameworks, dependencies, etc needed...  
Just copy files and execute.  
Enjoy the Tic Tac Toe Game.
